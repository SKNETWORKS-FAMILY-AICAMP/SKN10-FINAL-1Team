# Natural Language Processing Techniques

Natural Language Processing (NLP) combines computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning models to process and analyze human language data. Here are some key techniques used in modern NLP systems.

## Text Preprocessing

Before applying sophisticated algorithms, text data typically undergoes preprocessing:
- Tokenization: Breaking text into words, phrases, or subwords
- Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or dictionary form
- Stemming: Reducing words to their word stem
- Stop word removal: Filtering out common words with little semantic value
- Normalization: Converting text to a standard format

## Text Representation Models

Various approaches exist for representing text as numerical vectors:
- Bag-of-Words (BoW): Simple frequency-based representation
- TF-IDF: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency weighting
- Word Embeddings: Dense vector representations like Word2Vec and GloVe
- Contextual Embeddings: Context-aware representations from models like BERT

## Advanced NLP Tasks

Modern NLP systems can perform complex language tasks:
- Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined classes
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying entities like people, organizations
- Sentiment Analysis: Determining positive, negative, or neutral sentiment
- Machine Translation: Converting text from one language to another
- Question Answering: Providing answers to natural language questions
- Text Summarization: Generating concise summaries of longer documents
- Topic Modeling: Discovering abstract topics in a collection of documents
