# Artificial Intelligence Core Concepts

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Key machine learning paradigms include:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to analyze various factors of data. Deep learning is making major advances in solving problems that have resisted the best attempts of the artificial intelligence community for many years.

## Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that gives computers the ability to understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics.

Modern NLP applications include:
- Machine translation
- Sentiment analysis
- Text summarization
- Question answering systems
- Chatbots
