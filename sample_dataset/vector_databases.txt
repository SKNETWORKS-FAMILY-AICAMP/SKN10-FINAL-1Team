# Vector Databases and Semantic Search

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store, manage, and search vector embeddings efficiently. They've become essential components in modern AI systems that rely on semantic search capabilities.

## What are Vector Embeddings?

Vector embeddings are mathematical representations of data (such as text, images, or audio) as points in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between items - similar items have similar embeddings, regardless of lexical or syntactic differences.

## Dense vs. Sparse Embeddings

There are two main types of vector embeddings:

1. **Dense Embeddings**: Fixed-length, continuous vectors where every dimension has a value. They excel at capturing semantic similarity and meaning. Examples include word2vec, BERT embeddings, and OpenAI's text-embedding models.

2. **Sparse Embeddings**: Mostly zero-valued vectors with only a few non-zero elements. They're excellent for capturing exact keyword matches. Traditional methods like TF-IDF and BM25 produce sparse representations.

## Hybrid Search

Hybrid search combines both dense and sparse embeddings:
- Dense vectors find semantically related results
- Sparse vectors ensure exact keyword matches
- Combined, they provide more comprehensive search results
